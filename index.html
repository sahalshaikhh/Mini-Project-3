  <h1>History of Bitcoin:</h1>

  <section>
    Bitcoin is a <b> cryptocurrency</b>, a digital asset designed to work as
    a store of value that uses cryptography to control its creation and
    management, rather than relying on central authorities.<br /><br />
    [1] The history of bitcoin started with the invention and was
    implemented by the presumed pseudonymous
    <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, who integrated many existing ideas
    from the cryptography community. Over the course of bitcoin's history,
    it has undergone rapid growth to become a significant store of value
    both on- and offline. From the<big> mid-2010s</big>, some businesses
    began accepting bitcoin in addition to <em>traditional currencies</em>.
    <hr />
  </section>
  <h1><u>Background:</u></h1>

  Prior to the release of bitcoin, there were a number of digital cash
  technologies starting with the issuer based ecash protocols of David Chaum
  and Stefan Brands.The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could
  have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and
  Moni Naor in 1992. The idea was independently rediscovered by Adam Back
  who developed hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.
  The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity based
  cryptocurrencies were Wei Dai's b-money and Nick Szabo's bit gold. Hal
  Finney developed reusable proof of work (RPOW) using hashcash as its proof
  of work algorithm. In the bit gold proposal which proposed a collectible
  market-based mechanism for inflation control, Nick Szabo also investigated
  some additional aspects including a Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement
  protocol based on quorum addresses to store and transfer the chained
  proof-of-work solutions, which was vulnerable to Sybil attacks, though.

    <h1>Satoshi Nakamoto Main article:</h1>
    <airtle>
      "Satoshi Nakamoto" is presumed to be a pseudonym for the person or
      people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched
      the network in 2009. Nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority
      of the official bitcoin software and was active in making modifications
      and posting technical information on the bitcoin forum. There has been
      much speculation as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto with suspects
      including Dai, Szabo, and Finney – and accompanying denials. The
      possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer collective in the
      European financial sector has also been discussed. Investigations into
      the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto were attempted by The New Yorker
      and Fast Company. The New Yorker's investigation brought up at least two
      possible candidates: Michael Clear and Vili Lehdonvirta. Fast Company's
      investigation brought up circumstantial evidence linking an encryption
      patent application filed by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry
      on 15 August 2008, and the bitcoin.org domain name which was registered
      72 hours later. The patent application (#20100042841) contained
      networking and encryption technologies similar to bitcoin's, and textual
      analysis revealed that the phrase "... computationally impractical to
      reverse" appeared in both the patent application and bitcoin's
      whitepaper. All three inventors explicitly denied being Satoshi
      Nakamoto. In May 2013, Ted Nelson speculated that Japanese mathematician
      Shinichi Mochizuki is Satoshi Nakamoto. Later in 2013 the Israeli
      researchers Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir pointed to Silk Road-linked Ross
      William Ulbricht as the possible person behind the cover. The two
      researchers based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of
      bitcoin transactions. These allegations were contested and Ron and
      Shamir later retracted their claim. Nakamoto's involvement with bitcoin
      does not appear to extend past mid-2010. In April 2011, Nakamoto
      communicated with a bitcoin contributor, saying that he had "moved on to
      other things". Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member,
      graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's 500-plus bitcoin forum
      posts; the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts
      between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Because
      this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that
      Nakamoto was asleep at this time, and the hours of 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. GMT
      are midnight to 6 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (North American Eastern
      Standard Time). Other clues suggested that Nakamoto was British: A
      newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the
      UK-published newspaper The Times, and both his forum posts and his
      comments in the bitcoin source code used British English spellings, such
      as "optimise" and "colour". An Internet search by an anonymous blogger
      of texts similar in writing to the bitcoin whitepaper suggests Nick
      Szabo's "bit gold" articles as having a similar author. Nick denied
      being Satoshi, and stated his official opinion on Satoshi and bitcoin in
      a May 2011 article. In a March 2014 article in Newsweek, journalist Leah
      McGrath Goodman doxed Dorian S. Nakamoto of Temple City, California,
      saying that Satoshi Nakamoto is the man's birth name. Her methods and
      conclusion drew widespread criticism. In June 2016, the London Review of
      Books published a piece by Andrew O'Hagan about Nakamoto. After a May
      2020 YouTube documentary pointed to Adam Back as the creator of bitcoin,
      widespread discussion ensued. The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto
      still remains a matter of dispute.
